## 3) Cross-Case Memos (Analytic)

### Memo A — Career Stage Differences (Early vs Mid/Late)
- **Early career (Keiani):** Emphasizes belonging, learning, mentorship/sponsorship, and permission to be authentic.
- **Mid-career (Jasmine):** Emphasizes purpose alignment, structural justice work, and operational/system building.
- **Late career/established (Sandra):** Emphasizes communication strategy, cross-cultural humanity, brand visibility, and long-term commitment to underserved communities.
- **Professionally licensed advocate (Kim):** Emphasizes patient advocacy, institutional bias, community health outcomes, and building pipelines for nurses of color.

### Memo B — Work Environment as “Container” for Purpose
- Supportive environments (BFP, nursing advocacy networks) enable authenticity and experimentation.
- Misaligned environments (film program structure; segregated South socialization) are described as constraints that participants exit or reframe.

### Memo C — “Commonality” as a Repeated Strategy
- Sandra: common thread/common core in PR messaging.
- Kim: community/common-unity as anti-division practice.
- Keiani: coalition building broadened (non-Black supporters).

## 5) Open Questions for Next Iteration
- What specific workplace behaviors create “cared for” and “heard” experiences (Keiani) and could they be measured?
- How do “purpose” narratives differ across professions (justice vs healthcare vs media)?
- Where do participants describe explicit discrimination at work vs systemic inequity outside the workplace?
